# Toy Trading Exchange (Python)
A simple toy limit-order exchange in python. 

Currently this project plans to implement: 
- Limit Orders (BUY/SELL)
- an order book (bids/asks)
- a basic matching engine (price time priority at top-of-book)
- trade generation for crossed orders
- best bid / best ask output 

Right now the goal is to have a minimal working exchange with plans to add partial fills and other features, as this project develops.
